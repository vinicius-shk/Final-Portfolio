  "aboutMe": "My name is Vin√≠cius Shkromada de Oliveira, I'm 33 years old, and I'm passionate about games in all forms. I am a board game collector and a gastronomy enthusiast, an area in which I worked for years. However, I decided to pursue my true calling, which is web development. I graduated from Trybe and currently work as a FullStack developer. While I am currently focused on the BackEnd area, I have sought to deepen my knowledge in languages such as TypeScript and Python. I am always looking for ways to improve myself and test my skills. Currently, I am studying design patterns and starting to explore Java to delve deeper into object-oriented programming."
